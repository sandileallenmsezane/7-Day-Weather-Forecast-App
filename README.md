# 🌦️ Weather Forecast Web App
## 📘 Project Scenario

Build a web application that allows users to view a 5-day weather forecast for various European cities. The user selects a city from a dropdown list, and weather cards are dynamically displayed using data fetched from the 7Timer! API.

## 🧠 Skills Demonstrated

    JavaScript DOM manipulation

    Asynchronous API fetching

    UI/UX design using Bootstrap

    Responsive web design

## 🛠️ Tools Used

    HTML

    CSS

    JavaScript

    Bootstrap

    7Timer! Weather API

## 📝 Summary

This project aims to provide a simple and interactive weather forecast interface that users can access directly in their browser. It uses real-time data and visually presents weather conditions through custom icons, text overlays, and styled forecast cards.

## ✅ Solution

The app loads a CSV file of European city coordinates, populates a dropdown menu, and fetches weather data from the 7Timer! API upon city selection. Forecast cards are dynamically generated, displaying weather icons, temperature, and wind information for each 3-hour interval. Bootstrap and CSS are used for layout, responsiveness, and visual styling, including a blurred transparent card effect and rounded elements.

## 🔍 Approach

    CSV Parsing: Extracted latitude, longitude, city, and country from a local CSV file.

    Event Handling: Added listeners to fetch and display forecast data upon user interaction.

    UI Design: Used Bootstrap for layout, a blurred background effect on cards, and enhanced accessibility through clear fonts and rounded components.

    Error Handling: Incorporated graceful error messages if data fails to load or the API returns invalid responses.

    Loading Indicator: Displays a loading GIF while data is being fetched.
